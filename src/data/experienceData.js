    dateRange: "Dec 2023 - May 2023",
    achievements: [
      "Classified sea ice using SAR imagery to monitor northern waterways and forecast ice levels for climate change analysis.",
      "Engineered data pipeline automation using Bash scripting for ASF-VERTEX data acquisition, reducing manual processing time from 1 hours/day to near-zero for a dataset of 36 SAR images.",
      "Optimized image preprocessing by implementing parallel computing solutions using Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing, improving execution speed by 84% (25 minutes to 4 minutes) for 12GB of SAR data.",
      "After conducting a comprehensive literature review, selected Conv-LSTM(97.33%) and ResNet(96%) for training on the acquired SAR data.",
      "Completed the project with a detailed report documenting the entire methodology. Additionally, assisted the team with code review for TransAISformer, a model designed to predict approximate ship locations."
