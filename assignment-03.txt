Fashion mnist data is given. Mnist data is about digits, sort-of like helloworld type of dataset, person who wants to start their careers in AI/ML use this dataset as their smooth start. Later, group of researcher have created another dataset call fashion dataset. 

Fashion MNIST is a dataset designed as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset, containing 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of 10 fashion-related categories, such as T-shirts, sneakers, and bags. It is widely used for benchmarking image classification models, particularly in deep learning. Unlike MNIST's handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST provides a more complex and realistic challenge for modern computer vision tasks while maintaining a similar structure to ensure easy adoption in existing models.

But dataset that we are working with have added twist. Author of this dataset modified label of dataset such that instead of 10 there are now 5 labels. And our task is to perform Deep learning algorithm to get an insight about labeling and improving result of proposed benchmark using various techniques that have been learned during course.
